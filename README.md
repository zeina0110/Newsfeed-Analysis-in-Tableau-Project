# Newsfeed-Analysis-in-Tableau-Project
The primary objective is to produce graphs examining user interaction patterns with the newsfeed feature on the 365 platform. To achieve this, design a Tableau dashboard highlighting significant insights 
#Before you begin, examine the given data using the View Data feature.

============================================================================================
Newsfeed posts have the following subtypes:

    Career track certificate (automated): Denotes earning certificates for completing career tracks.
    Collection (automated): Indicates students gathering card collections as awards.
    Course certificate (automated): Represents earning course completion certificates.
    Goal (automated): Showcases students achieving predefined goals (like weekly learning hours).
    Level (automated): Highlights user profile advancement to a new level.
    Streak (automated): Demonstrates student's consistent engagement in learning.
    Text post (manual): Involves user-generated textual content sharing personal opinions and observations.

Monthly Post Activity and Average Likes:

        A dual chart with a bar chart that displays the monthly count of posts and relevant average likes per post. This graph provides insights into the content's popularity.
        It helps analyze whether posts with higher likes are concentrated within specific months, 
        assists in identifying trends in user engagement, and enables discovering seasonality in student engagement activity.

Insights:

        After examining all subtypes using the appropriate dashboard filter, it's evident that the Level-type and Collection-type posts are the least popular.
        This observation is supported by the graph showing monthly average likes and the ratio of likes to the total number of posts.
        
        Collection: Out of  9,376 posts 170 received likes
        Level: Out of 22,313 posts, 422 received likes.
        The notably low average of around 0.02 likes per post for both categories underscores this conclusion.

        We should consult the Subtype Post Distribution graph to determine the most and least frequent post types.
        This visualization indicates that the Level-type posts are the most prevalent, appearing 22,313 times,
        whereas the Career Track Certificate posts are the least frequent, with only 144 instances.
        The count is comparable to the second least common post subtype—the manual Text post, with 150 examples.

        Based on our observations, Level-type posts dominate the newsfeed, surpassing all other subtypes.
        Their total count is twice that of the runner-up, the Course Certificate post. Despite their frequency,
        the trend indicates that Level-type posts—alongside the Collection post subtype—generate minimal interest and seldom entice users to engage with likes.

        This suggests that Level-type posts might be saturating the newsfeed with content users don't find compelling,
        thereby diminishing their overall experience with the feature.
        A wise strategy might be to reevaluate how these posts are generated and curtail their prevalence on the newsfeed.
        More engaging posts can take the forefront, potentially elevating user engagement and bolstering interest in the feature—ensuring
        more captivating posts remain visible rather than those with fewer likes
